# About the project

[OpenFisca](https://www.openfisca.fr/) is a versatile microsimulation software.
OpenFisca allows users to :
- Calculate many variables of the tax and benefit legislation of a country (social benefits and taxes paid by households) given input variables.
- Simulate the budgetary consequences of a reform and its distributional impact when plugged on a survey.
Its engine is independent of the country, it is therefore possible to simulate any country.
For now the main supported country is France.

[OpenFisca](https://www.openfisca.fr/) is free and is published under the [GNU Affero General Public Licence](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html) version 3 or later.

## Project Components

OpenFisca is a modular project. Depending on your goals, you will install and interact with one or several of the OpenFisca Components.

### Web API
The Web API lets you access the legislation Parameters and Variables.

>**Example**: [Mes Aides](https://mes-aides.gouv.fr) uses the OpenFisca Web API to calculate OpenFisca-France benefits.

- To explore the OpenFisca-France Web API services, use the [French Legistation Explorer](https://legislation.openfisca.fr/)
- To query the Openfisca Web API in your app, see our [Web API endpoints description](https://doc.openfisca.fr/openfisca-web-api/endpoints.html)
- To host your own instance of the Openfisca API, go to our [installation documentation](https://doc.openfisca.fr/openfisca-web-api/index.html)

### Extensions Packages
Extensions add on the capacities of a country-package.

>**Example**: See Paris extension and Rennes extension on top of OpenFisca France, Pension extension on top of OpenFisca-Tunisia

- To install an Extension, head to the [Extensions documentation](https://doc.openfisca.fr/contribute/extensions.html)
- To create a new Extension, head to the [Extension Template on GitHub](https://doc.openfisca.fr/contribute/extensions.html)

### Country package
Country Packages are the basic modules of OpenFisca. They define the [Parameters](https://doc.openfisca.fr/parameters.html), [Entities](https://doc.openfisca.fr/person,_entities,_role.html) and [Variables](https://doc.openfisca.fr/variables.html) of a country.

- To install an existing Country-Package, head to the [OpenFisca First Steps page](https://doc.openfisca.fr/first_step.html)
- To create a new Country Package, head to the [Country Template on GitHub](https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-extension-template)

### OpenFisca Core
OpenFisca-Core is the main engine: it is the common interface to every Country Package. 

It binds the Web API, Country Package(s), Extension(s) and the engine together. 

To install OpenFisca-Core, read our [Install Manual](https://doc.openfisca.fr/install.html).
## What's the purpose?

OpenFisca is more a platform than an application: its first target is not the end user but
economists, software developers, researchers, teachers, administrations, interested citizens, etc.

Final products can be built on the top of OpenFisca.
They trigger tax and benefit variables computations via the web API.
For example: [Mes aides](https://mes-aides.gouv.fr/).

Then, the web API of OpenFisca is used by the team itself to develop tools like the [legislation explorer](https://legislation.openfisca.fr/).

These tools are designed to help developers understand the legislation when they write it down into source code,
and allow citizens to browse the tax and benefit legislation.

The current version implements a large set of taxes, social benefits and housing provision for France
for the last 10 years.
But this is only due to a shortage in manpower to enter and update the Tunisian legislation.

The project is 100% free software, it is published on [GitHub](https://github.com/openfisca).
It uses the GitHub infrastructure (issues, pull requests, etc.) to communicate internally or with external participants.
The team discusses publically on those issues and pull requests and tries to be as transparent as possible.

The project is multi-actors: many people and organizations are involved in the project,
reading the legislation and transforming it into source code,
developing the Core or web tools,
developing external products, etc.

Among them:
[Etalab](https://www.etalab.gouv.fr/),
the [<abbr title="Institut des politiques publiques">IPP</abbr>](http://www.ipp.eu/),
the "startups d'état" of the
[<abbr title="Secrétariat général pour la modernisation de l'action publique">SGMAP</abbr>](http://www.modernisation.gouv.fr/),
the [<abbr title="Institut d'économie publique">IDEP</abbr>](http://www.idep-fr.org/)
and [France Stratégie](http://www.strategie.gouv.fr/).

OpenFisca provides a basic infrastructure, in particular a public instance of its web API,
hosted on cheap servers.
As it is free software, anyone can reproduce the OpenFisca infrastructure on its server.

## What is microsimulation?

TODO

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsimulation

## Technical choices

OpenFisca is written in the [Python](http://www.python.org/) programming language. It is compatible with version 2.7.

OpenFisca can calculate tax and benefit variables on test cases (a person or a household)
or population data (real data or survey data).
To achieve both, computations are vectorial.
For performance reasons the [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) package is used.
It is coded in the C language under the hood, more performant than Python.

## Project history

The development of OpenFisca began in May 2011 at the
[<abbr title="Centre d'analyse stratégique">CAS</abbr>](http://www.strategie.gouv.fr/)
(renamed France Stratégie / Commissariat général à la stratégie et à la prospective in April 2013)
with the support of the
[<abbr title="Institut d'économie publique">IDEP</abbr>](http://www.idep-fr.org/).

The source code has been released under a free software license in November 2011.

OpenFisca was originally developed as a desktop application
using the [Qt](http://www.qt.io/) library with a Python API.

In the early 2014, when <a href="https://www.etalab.gouv.fr/" rel="external" target="_blank">Etalab</a>
started being implicated in the development of OpenFisca, it was decided to:

- separate the computing engine from its desktop user interface
- offer a web API in addition to the Python API
- demonstrate the value of the web API by developing sample applications including a web interface
  to simulate personal cases
- propose a public access to this web API open to all: administrations, researchers, citizens, etc.

Since then, the software is being developed extensively by
[Etalab](https://www.etalab.gouv.fr/).
Meanwhile the economic model is being improved and the tax and benefit legislation updated by the
[<abbr title="Commissariat général à la stratégie et à la prospective">CGSP</abbr>](http://www.strategie.gouv.fr/)
with the help of the
the [<abbr title="Institut d'économie publique">IDEP</abbr>](http://www.idep-fr.org/)
and the [<abbr title="Institut des politiques publiques">IPP</abbr>](http://www.ipp.eu/).

As of now (March 2014), the Qt version is no longer maintained and only the Python and the web APIs are being developed.
