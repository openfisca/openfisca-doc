Thank you for wanting to contribute to OpenFisca! :smiley:

## Copywriting

British English is used in the documentation.

## Pull requests

We follow the [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/get-started/using-github/github-flow): all code contributions are submitted via a pull request towards the `main` branch.

Opening a Pull Request means you want that code to be merged. If you want to only discuss it, send a link to your branch along with your questions through whichever communication channel you prefer.

### Peer reviews

All pull requests must be reviewed by someone else than their original author.

> In case of a lack of available reviewers, one may review oneself, but only after at least 24 hours have passed without working on the code to review.

To help reviewers, make sure to add to your PR a **clear text explanation** of your changes.
