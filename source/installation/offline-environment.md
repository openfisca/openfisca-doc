# Install in an offline environment

If you need to install OpenFisca on a server with no Internet access, here is how to do it.

The big picture: download Python packages on a machine with Internet access, copy them to the server and install them in a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/).

We assume that it is possible to copy files to the server, for example via a USB stick. Or perhaps the server filters only outgoing connections, but accepts incoming connections allowing to copy the files.

## On the machine with Internet access

We are going to create a first virtualenv in which we'll use `pip` to download the `.whl` files in a specific directory.

Here we use [pew](https://github.com/berdario/pew) to simplify virtualenv management.

```sh
pip install pew
pew new openfisca-packages --python=python3.7

# Upgrade pip itself
pip install --upgrade pip
pip --version
# Should print at least 9.0 at the time we write this doc.

mkdir ~/openfisca-packages
cd ~/openfisca-packages
pip download OpenFisca-France
# You should see the downloaded files in the current directory.
```

Now copy these files on the server (say in the `~/openfisca-packages` directory), either via a USB stick, or with `scp`, or any other way.

Example with `scp`:

```sh
scp -r ~/openfisca-packages user@server:
```

## On the server

Starting from here we assume you copied the packages on the server, say in `~/openfisca-packages`.

The following commands show how to install Python packages without any Internet access.
If you already have a virtualenv, activate it. Otherwise create a new one following the same instructions as above (for example with `pew new`).

```sh
pip install ~/openfisca-packages/*
    Processing ./isodate-0.5.4.tar.gz
    [...]
    Installing collected packages: pytz, Babel, Biryani, numpy, PyYAML, OpenFisca-Core, requests, OpenFisca-France, isodate
    Successfully installed Babel-2.3.4 Biryani-0.10.4 OpenFisca-Core-7.0.0 OpenFisca-France-15.1.0 PyYAML-3.12 isodate-0.5.4 numpy-1.12.0 pytz-2016.10 requests-2.13.0

pip list | grep OpenFisca-France
    OpenFisca-France 15.1.0
```

Run the basic tests which confirm that OpenFisca-France is correctly installed:

```sh
python -m openfisca_france.tests.test_basics
OpenFisca-France basic test was executed successfully.
```
