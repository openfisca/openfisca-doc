# Install a country web API

These instructions are for installing an OpenFisca country package in a local environment. The `OpenFisca-Country-Template` package is used as an example here and should be substituted for the specific country package relevant to the use case.

## Run and call a local web API

OpenFisca runs with [Python](https://www.python.org/). If it's not installed in the environment, check the [Installation requirements](installation-requirements.md#install-python) section.

To run a local `OpenFisca-Country-Template` web API:

1. Install the `OpenFisca-Country-Template` in the local environment as described by it's `README` [Install Instructions for Users and Contributors](https://github.com/openfisca/country-template#install-instructions-for-users-and-contributors) section,

2. Serve the web API on your environment by running the one command described [here](https://github.com/openfisca/country-template#serve-this-country-package-with-the-openfisca-web-api).
