# How to test your changes on "ready to use" situations

Often, when making changes to legislation it needs testing on a simulation that works with your country's tax and benefit system.
Sometimes, these simulations can be quite complicated to model.
Instead of rewriting them everytime, first check your country's repository for `situation_examples` that have already been created. 
If what you need does not exist, you could create your own examples and contribute them to the repository.
