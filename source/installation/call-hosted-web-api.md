# Call a public web API

You can rely on a demonstration instance for the `OpenFisca-Country-Template` web API hosted by OpenFisca community. You can test it and interact with this web API endpoints through [this swagger interface](https://legislation.demo.openfisca.org/swagger). 

For further information on the possible requests, [this section of the documentation](./../openfisca-web-api/endpoints.md) describes OpenFisca web APIs endpoints.

> ðŸ’¡ Other OpenFisca models might have their own hosted web APIs. If you are looking for an already hosted instance for a specific country package, we recommend you to check the terms of use and contact the maintaining team.

Later, before pushing your web application in production, we advise you to host your own instance as service uptime is not garanteed by the `OpenFisca-Country-Template` demonstration instance. Besides, this will allow you to choose when you need to migrate the main revision of the country package served by the web API. 
The [Install the country package web API](./install-openfisca-web-api.md) is here to help you!
