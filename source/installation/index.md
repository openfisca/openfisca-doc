This section allows you to install the `OpenFisca-Country-Template` as a generic example of an OpenFisca model. This will also allow you to run the documentation examples on your local environment.

> To install a real country model, we advise you to refer to the model repository documentation (usually, the README file).


If you are working on a Web application or/and would like to test the Web API online, no installation is needed. See further information on the [Call a public Web API](call-hosted-web-api.md) page. 


To test OpenFisca syntaxes and start writing some law or regulation rule, the [Install the OpenFisca-Country-Template page](./install-openfisca-country-template.md) is here for you!

Then, if you want to call the model throught your own instance of OpenFisca Web API to run some calculations for a website, see the [Test or install the OpenFisca-Country-Template Web API](./install-openfisca-web-api.md) page.


## Installation issues in specific environments

As the OpenFisca community becomes larger, issues that only affect a small percentage of users arise.

The purpose of this section is to bring together the clever solutions the community came up with and share them with all OpenFisca users.
