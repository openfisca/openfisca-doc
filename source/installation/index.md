OpenFisca is a modular project as described in [Project components section](./../projectcomponents.md).

This section allows you to install the `OpenFisca-Country-Template` as a generic example of an OpenFisca model. This will also allow you to run the documentation examples on your local environment.

To install an existing country model, we advise you to refer to the model repository documentation (usually, the README file). 

## Installation issues in specific environments

As the OpenFisca community becomes larger, issues that only affect a small percentage of users arise.

The purpose of this section is to bring together the clever solutions the community came up with and share them with all OpenFisca users.
