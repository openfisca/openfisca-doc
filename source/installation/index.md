This section guides you in installing the [`OpenFisca-Country-Template`](https://github.com/openfisca/country-template) country package as a generic example of an OpenFisca country package. This will also allow you to run the documentation examples on your local environment.

This model is fictitious and you will obviously want to work with one that models the set of rules of an actual jurisdiction. The steps for installing should be similar for every package, but we advise you to refer to your target country package repository documentation for specific instructions.

If you are working on a web application or/and would like to test the web API online, no installation is needed. 
See further information on the [Call a public web API](call-hosted-web-api.md) page. 

To test OpenFisca syntaxes and start writing some law or regulation rule, the [Install the OpenFisca-Country-Template page](./install-openfisca-country-template.md) is here for you!

Then, if you want to call the model throught your own instance of OpenFisca Web API to run some calculations for a website, see the [Test or install the OpenFisca-Country-Template Web API](./install-openfisca-web-api.md) page.

## Installation issues in specific environments

As the OpenFisca community becomes larger, issues that only affect a small percentage of users arise.
