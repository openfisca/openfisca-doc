# Test or install the OpenFisca-Country-Template web API

You can call `OpenFisca-Country-Template` web API without installing it by [relying on the demonstration instance](./call-hosted-web-api.md). Or install it on your local environment for further testing.

## Run and call a local instance

> This step requires the [Python installation](./install-python.md).

To run a local instance of `OpenFisca-Country-Template` web API, you need to: 
1. install `OpenFisca-Country-Template` on your local environment as described by the [Install Instructions for Users and Contributors](https://github.com/openfisca/country-template#install-instructions-for-users-and-contributors) section of the README,
2. serve the web API on your environment by running one command as described [here](https://github.com/openfisca/country-template#serve-this-country-package-with-the-openfisca-web-api).
