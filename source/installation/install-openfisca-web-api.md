# Install the country package web API

You can call `OpenFisca-Country-Template` web API without installing it by [relying on the demonstration instance](./call-hosted-web-api.md). Or install it on your local environment for further testing by following this section.

## Run and call a local instance

OpenFisca runs with [Python](https://www.python.org/). If it's not installed on your environment, the [presets Python install section](presets.md#install-python) is here for you!

To run a local instance of `OpenFisca-Country-Template` web API, you need to: 

1. Install `OpenFisca-Country-Template` on your local environment as described by its `README` [Install Instructions for Users and Contributors](https://github.com/openfisca/country-template#install-instructions-for-users-and-contributors) section,

2. Serve the web API on your environment by running one command as described [here](https://github.com/openfisca/country-template#serve-this-country-package-with-the-openfisca-web-api).
