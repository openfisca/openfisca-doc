# Install Python

OpenFisca runs with [Python](https://www.python.org/).
Python installation depends on your operating system.

(+ version et o√π step by step country template)

You will find the default installation instructions in [Python official documentation](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Then here are some recommendations for Docker or Windows users:
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com) users can create a container and rely on [Python official image](https://hub.docker.com/_/python) instead.
* Microsoft Windows users, can also rely [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) package and environment manager to use [OpenFisca-Country-Template](https://anaconda.org/search?q=openfisca-country-template) or one of the openfisca packages [published as conda packages](https://anaconda.org/search?q=openfisca).
  
  We recommend this option for an easier installation but the [available packages list](https://anaconda.org/search?q=openfisca) is shorter.  
  
  To install Python through conda: 
  * install the [Anaconda distribution](https://anaconda.org) for Python and conda.
  * or, for users with less disk space, install the minimal [Miniconda distribution](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for Python and conda.
