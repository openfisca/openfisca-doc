This section presents the key concepts required to have a good understanding of OpenFisca, without being too technical.

The first entries are dedicated to the **definitions of the structure** of OpenFisca:

- [Tax and Benefit System](tax_and_benefit_system.md) as the matrix of the software
- [Variables](variables.md)
- [Parameters](parameters.md)
- [Person, entities, role](person_entities_role.md)
- [Periods, Instants](periods_instants.md)

The last sections present different **applications** of OpenFisca.

- [Simulation, Computation](simulation.md)
- [Reforms](reforms.md)

We use the French legislation to illustrate these concepts. French names are kept as they are.
