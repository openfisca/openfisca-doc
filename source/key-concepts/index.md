This section presents the key concepts required to have a good understanding of OpenFisca, without being too technical.

The first entries are dedicated to the **definitions of the structure** of OpenFisca:
   * [Tax and Benefit System](tax_and_benefit_system.md) as the matrix of the software
   * [Variables](variables.md)
   * [Parameters](parameters.md)
   * [Person, entities, role](person,_entities,_role.md)
   * [Periods, Instants](periodsinstants.md)

Last sections present different **applications** of OpenFisca.

   * [Simulation, Computation](simulation.md)
   * [Reforms](reforms.md)

We use the French legislation to illustrate these concepts. French names are kept as it is.
