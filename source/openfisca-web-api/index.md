OpenFisca provides a web API package, compatible with all country packages.
Using a web interface, app developers can access information and computations without installing anything locally.

## Public France API

The latest version of the France web API is [`api.fr.openfisca.org/latest`](https://api.fr.openfisca.org/latest). Its endpoints are documented in [`fr.openfisca.org/legislation/swagger`](https://fr.openfisca.org/legislation/swagger). This API is provided for prototyping purposes only: it has no SLA (service level agreement, i.e. guarantee of availability) and is kept up to date automatically, with no regard for breaking changes. No support will be provided for this instance. You should not build production systems on top of it.

Anyone wanting a stable OpenFisca web API is invited to [host their own](#hosting-an-api-instance).

## Use Cases

The following services use the OpenFisca web API:

- [fr.openfisca.org/legislation](https://fr.openfisca.org/legislation), giving you information on available OpenFisca variables.
- [Mes Aides](https://mes-aides.gouv.fr), the French social benefits simulator.
- [PA-comp](https://pa-comp.firebaseapp.com), a divorce fiscal impact simulator.

## Conditions

Please remember that OpenFisca is free software, licensed under an [Affero GPL license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/). That means you have to provide access to the source code of the API you make available, including any changes you might have made on the original code. You also have to provide a link to the OpenFisca source code, and state its license, in a place that is easily discoverable by users of your software.

You could for example add one the following lines to a “credits” page:

```html
Computations done by <a href="https://openfisca.org">OpenFisca</a>, the <a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/" title="AGPL-3.0">free and open-source</a> social and fiscal computation engine. Source code available at <a href="https://github.com/openfisca">github.com/openfisca</a>.
```

```html
Calculs effectués par <a href="https://openfisca.org">OpenFisca</a>, le moteur <a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/" title="AGPL-3.0">libre et ouvert</a> du système social et fiscal. Code source disponible sur <a href="https://github.com/openfisca">github.com/openfisca</a>.
```

## Hosting an API instance

Let app developers access your country package information and computations by serving the web API that comes bundled with the OpenFisca-Core module. See the [technical documentation](https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-core#serving-the-api) for serving instructions.

### Track your API

If you want to track how your API is being used, you can install the [OpenFisca Tracker](https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-core#tracker).
