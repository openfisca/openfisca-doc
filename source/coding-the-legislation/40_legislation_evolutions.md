# Legislation evolutions

OpenFisca handles the fact that the legislation changes over time.

## Parameter evolution

Many legislation parameters are regularly re-evaluated while the variables using them stay the same.
>Example: the `taxes` parameter can change without altering the code of the `flat_tax_on_salary` variable that uses that parameter.

In that case, add the new parameter values and their start dates in the appropriate parameter files.

### How to update a parameter

#### Open the file where the parameter is described

```yaml
taxes:
  salary:
    rate:
      description: Rate for the flat tax on salaries
      values:
        2016-01-01:
          value: 0.25
          reference: https://www.legislation-source.com/2016
        2015-01-01:
          value: 0.20
          reference: https://www.legislation-source.com/2015
```

#### Add a new value to this parameter

```yaml
taxes:
  salary:
    rate:
      description: Rate for the flat tax on salaries
      values:
        2017-01-01:
          value: 0.3
          reference: https://www.legislation-source.com/2017
        2016-01-01:
          value: 0.25
          reference: https://www.legislation-source.com/2016
        2015-01-01:
          value: 0.2
          reference: https://www.legislation-source.com/2015
```

After this change, in a formula:
- `parameters('2016-04').taxes.salary.rate` is `0.25`
- `parameters('2017-01').taxes.salary.rate` is `0.3`
- `parameters('2022-01').taxes.salary.rate` is `0.3`

[Read more about how to code parameters](./legislation_parameters.md).

## Formula evolution

Some fiscal or benefit mechanism significantly evolve over time and call for a change in the formula that computes them. In this case, a simple parameter adjustement is not enough.

For instance, let's assume that from the 1st of Jan. 2017, the `flat_tax_on_salary` is not applied anymore on the first `1000` earned by a person.

We implement this rule by adding a new formula to our variable, and _dating_ it:

```py
class flat_tax_on_salary(Variable):
    value_type = float
    entity = Person
    label = u"Individualized and monthly paid tax on salaries"
    definition_period = MONTH

    def formula_2017(person, period, parameters):
        salary = person('salary', period)
        salary_above_1000 = min_(salary - 1000, 0)
        return salary_above_1000 * parameters(period).taxes.salary.rate

    def formula(person, period, parameters):
        salary = person('salary', period)

        return salary * parameters(period).taxes.salary.rate
```

If the `flat_tax_on_salary` is calculated for a person **before** the 31st of Dec. 2016 (included), `formula` is used. If it is called **after** the 1st of Jan 2017 (included), `formula_2017` is used.

Formula naming rules:
- A formula name must always start with `formula`.
- To define a starting date for a formula, we add to its name a suffix made of an underscore followed by a date.
  - For instance, `formula_2017_01_01` is active from the 1st of Jan. 2017.
- When defining a date, the month is given **before** the day.
- When no month or day is specified, OpenFisca uses '01' as default value.
  - For instance, `formula_2017` is equivalent to `formula_2017_01_01`.
- If no date is specified for a formula, OpenFisca will consider that this formula has been active since the dawn of time (or more precisely, since `0001-01-01`, as Python does not handle B.C. dates).
  - For instance, `formula` is active on `2010`.
- A formula is active until another formula, starting later, becomes active and replaces it (or until the [variable `end` date](#ending-a-variable-at-a-specific-date) is reached).
  - For instance, `formula` is active until `2016-12-31` (included). On the day after, `2017-01-01`, `formula_2017` becomes active, and `formula` becomes inactive.


## Formula introduction

In our previous example, we assumed that `flat_tax_on_salary` had _always_ had a formula, since the dawn of time. This is a reasonable hypothesis if we are only interested in running computations for recent years.

But most fiscal and benefit mechanisms have been introduced at some point. Let's for instance assume that our `flat_tax_on_salary` only appeared in our legislation on the 1st of June 2005.

This is easily implemented by _dating_ the two formulas:

```py
class flat_tax_on_salary(Variable):
    value_type = float
    entity = Person
    label = u"Individualized and monthly paid tax on salaries"
    definition_period = MONTH

    def formula_2017(person, period, parameters):
        salary = person('salary', period)
        salary_above_1000 = min_(salary - 1000, 0)
        return salary_above_1000 * parameters(period).taxes.salary.rate

    def formula_2005_06(person, period, parameters):
        salary = person('salary', period)

        return salary * parameters(period).taxes.salary.rate
```

Only a few characters changed in comparison with the last example: the suffix `_2005_06` has been added to the second formula name.

Note that if `flat_tax_on_salary` is calculated **before** `2005-05-31` (included), _none_ of the two formulas is used, as they are _both inactive_ at this time. Instead, **the variable [default value](../key-concepts/variables.md#default-values) is returned**.


## Ending a variable at a specific date

As legislation evolves, some fiscal or benefit mechanisms disappear.

Let's for instance assume that a `progressive_income_tax` used to exist before the `flat_tax_on_salary` was introduced. This progressive tax then disappeared on the 1st of June 2005.

This is implemented with an `end` attribute that defines the _last day_ a variable can be calculated:

```py
class progressive_income_tax(Variable):
    value_type = float
    entity = Person
    label = u"Former tax replaced by the flat tax on the 1st of June 2005"
    definition_period = MONTH
    end = '2005-05-31'

    def formula(person, period, legislation):
        # Apply a marginal scale to the person's income
        ...
```

If `progressive_income_tax` is called **before** `2005-05-31`(included), `formula` will be used.

However, if `progressive_income_tax` is calculated **after** `2005-06-01` (included), `formula` is **not** used, as it is not active anymore at this time. Instead, **the variable [default value](../key-concepts/variables.md#default-values) is returned**.

Note that:
- The `end` day is **inclusive**: it is the last day a variable and its formulas are active (and not the first day it is not active anymore).
- The `end` value is a string of format `YYYY-MM-DD` where `YYYY`, `MM` and `DD` are respectively a year, month and day.
- When defining a date, the month is given **before** the day.


## Ending a parameter at a specific date

Like variables, parameters tend to disappear as legislation evolves.

For instance, let's assume that the `housing_allowance` parameter is only defined from 2010 (1st of January) to the end of 2016 (31st of December).

We can end `housing_allowance` at a specific date by simply assigning `null` as a value for that date (`2017-01-01` in this case).

```yaml
description: Housing allowance amount (as a fraction of the rent)
# in parameters/housing_allowance.yaml
metadata:
  unit: /1
values:
  # This parameter is only defined from the 1st of Jan 2010 to the 1st of Jan 2017 (excluded).
  2010-01-01:
    value: 0.25
  2017-01-01:
    value: null
```
If `housing_allowance` is called **before** `2016-12-31`(included) and **after** `2010-01-01` (included), the `0.25` value will be used.

However, trying to obtain the parameter **after** `2017-01-01`(included) will raise an error:


> Example:
>```py 
>tax_benefit_system.parameters(2017).benefits.housing_allowance
>```
> Output:
>```py
>ParameterNotFoundError: The parameter 'benefits[housing_allowance]' was not found in the 2017-01-01 tax and benefit system.
>```

### Ending a scale at a specific date

The same thing can be done for a scale by assigning a `null` value for the end date across all brackets.

The following example of `social_security_contribution` ends as of the 1st of January 2017.

```yaml
description: Social security contribution tax scale
metadata:
  threshold_unit: currency-EUR
  rate_unit: /1
brackets:
- rate:
    2013-01-01:
      value: 0.03
    2017-01-01:
      value: null
  threshold:
    2013-01-01:
      value: 0.0
    2017-01-01:
      value: null
- rate:
    2013-01-01:
      value: 0.1
    2017-01-01:
      value: null
  threshold:
    2013-01-01:
      value: 12000.0
    2017-01-01:
      value: null
```
It is also possible to only end one bracket. We use the same `social_security_contribution` example to illustrate, by ending only the second bracket as of the 1st of January 2017.

```yaml
description: Social security contribution tax scale
metadata:
  threshold_unit: currency-EUR
  rate_unit: /1
brackets:
- rate: # 1st bracket
    2013-01-01:
      value: 0.03
    2017-01-01:
      value: 0.04
  threshold:
    2013-01-01:
      value: 0.0
- rate: # 2nd bracket
    2013-01-01:
      value: 0.1
    2017-01-01:
      value: null
  threshold:
    2013-01-01:
      value: 12000.0
    2017-01-01:
      value: null
```
