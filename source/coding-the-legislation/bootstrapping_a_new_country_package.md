# Bootstrapping a new country package

If you want to use OpenFisca to run simulations about your own country's legislation, our [country package template](https://github.com/openfisca/country-template/) will provide you all the instructions and boilerplate code you need to quickly get something working.

If you want to see more complex and complete examples of legislation coded in OpenFisca, you can check the [French](https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-france), [Tunisian](https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-tunisia) and [Senegalese](https://github.com/openfisca/senegal) country packages.
