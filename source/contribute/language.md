# Language

The development language is English. All comments and documentation in common repositories should be written in English, so that contributions can be made by developers around the world.

## Country-specific repositories

Some repositories define the tax and benefit system of a specific country. In such cases, the language used throughout issues and pull requests should be one of the native languages of that country.

For instance, `openfisca-france` issues and pull-requests should be written in French.

> The end goal is always to maximise contributions and collaboration. In that case, the main contributors will be experts from that country, and English should not be a barrier to entry.
