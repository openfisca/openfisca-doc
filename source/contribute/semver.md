# Semantic versioning guidelines

Before merging your contribution to an OpenFisca package, you are required to increment the version of this package.

The [semantic versioning convention](http://semver.org/), applied here, requires you to:

> Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
>
> - **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes,
> - **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
> - **PATCH** version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

It is thus crucial to determine whether your changes are **backwards-compatible**. If, during a hackathon, a contributor has written a reform to OpenFisca, would this reform still work after adding your changes?

## Examples in OpenFisca context
