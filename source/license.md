## Changes

If you modify or extend OpenFisca, you are [legally required](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/) to make those changes available to the community. The easiest way to do it is to publish your fork of the core package, and any country package, extension or reform, on a source hosting platform such as GitHub, and to notify the core team of this publication.

You can read [this analysis](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/107883/agpl-what-you-can-do-and-what-you-cant/314908/) to get more insight into what you can and can't do with APGL-licensed software.

If you see opportunities in developing services/businesses/tools on top of OpenFisca but are concerned with the AGPL3 license implications, please [open an issue](https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-core/issues/new) to have a public discussion on the topic.
